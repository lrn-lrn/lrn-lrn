- Card with (randomized) vocab word is presented along with two options: IDK || YES (maybe emojis)
- User clicks to indicate understanding or lack of for each word
- User can also use left/right arrows instead of buttons
- After going through all vocab words (approx 50), user is shown results in chart:
  - Col headers = vocab words, sorted by topic or alphabetically
  - Rows = session data, checks or x's (maybe emojis)

- chart:
  - on hover over an X, user can get resources or tutorials, etc, to learn about topic
